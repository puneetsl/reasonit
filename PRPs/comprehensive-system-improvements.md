### 3. Meta-Reasoning Knowledge Base for Tricky Problems
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Effort**: 3-4 weeks  
**Impact**: Dramatically improves handling of complex, tricky questions through strategic reasoning guidance

**Vision**: A curated knowledge base that teaches the system **HOW** to approach different types of tricky problems, not specific answers. This provides strategic reasoning patterns and logical frameworks for complex scenarios.

**Problem Examples**:
- **Logical Paradoxes**: "This statement is false" → Apply paradox resolution strategies
- **Multi-Step Deduction**: Complex logical chains → Break down systematically  
- **Ambiguous Questions**: Multiple interpretations → Clarify assumptions first
- **Counterintuitive Problems**: Against common sense → Question assumptions
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions → Consider extreme scenarios

**Implementation Plan**:

#### 3.1 Problem Pattern Recognition
- **Query Classification**: Identify tricky question types (paradox, deduction, ambiguous, etc.)
- **Complexity Scoring**: Rate questions on logical complexity, ambiguity, counterintuitiveness
- **Pattern Matching**: Match incoming queries to known tricky patterns

#### 3.2 Strategic Reasoning Templates
- **Logical Deduction Framework**: 
  ```
  "For complex logical chains: 1) Identify all premises, 2) Check for hidden assumptions, 
   3) Apply formal logic rules step-by-step, 4) Verify each inference"
  ```
- **Paradox Resolution Strategies**:
  ```
  "For paradoxes: 1) Identify the contradictory elements, 2) Question the framework, 
   3) Look for hidden assumptions, 4) Consider meta-levels of reasoning"
  ```
- **Ambiguity Handling**:
  ```
  "For ambiguous questions: 1) List all possible interpretations, 2) State assumptions explicitly, 
   3) Solve for each interpretation, 4) Compare results"
  ```

#### 3.3 Strategic Knowledge Base Structure
```json

  "problem_patterns": {
    "logical_paradox": {
      "indicators": ["self-reference", "contradiction", "infinite_regress"],
